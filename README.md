![Interface preview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25466/3174581/3520a7de-ebf3-11e3-9907-a0e4b77fce0b.png)

Selector provides a search and select interface for associative Symphony fields. It works with core select boxes and tag lists as well as with [Association fields](https://github.com/symphonists/association_field).

### Installation

1. Upload Selector to your `extensions` folder.
2. Enable Selector in the backend.
3. Add an associative field to your section and choose one of the interface.

Please keep in mind that interface are only available in combination with dynamic values, if you are using default select boxes or tag lists.

#### Modes

There are two modes:

- single select
- multiple select

#### Sorting

Sorting is currently only available for [Association fields](https://github.com/symphonists/association_field).

#### Custom Captions

It's possible to include markup in your related field in order to create more informative item captions. Selector bundles styles for text, image previews and emphasis. If you'd like to combine multiple field values into a single caption, please take a look at [Reflection field](https://github.com/symphonists/reflectionfield).

### Acknowledgement

The interface of Selector is based on [Selectize by Brian Reavis](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js) bundled with the Symphony core.
